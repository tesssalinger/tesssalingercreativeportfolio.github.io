                        Curating Your Online Identity: A Personal Journey
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In today’s digital age, the narrative we craft online is just as important as the one we tell in person.  Your online identity can open doors, build connections, and even define your professional trajectory.

                        As a creative, so much of your worth is tied to how much work you share in the open. Being online today can be both joyful and quite taxing. On the optimistic side, it’s fantastic to connect with other creatives and receive feedback and praise for your hard work. However, on the more pessimistic side, it can feel incredibly vulnerable to share something you’ve meticulously curated over weeks, months, or even years in just a simple Instagram post. That piece you poured your heart into can be reduced to a comment like, “I don’t really like this,” which can change your entire perspective on it.

                        Creating art is deeply personal; it requires introspection about what you value, what you like, and what you don’t. I’ve had to accept that not everyone will appreciate my work, and similarly, not everyone will like me. Art is subjective, and unlike other industries where you can measure success based on metrics, art often requires you to judge its value based on your own feelings.
                    </p>

                        Curating a digital identity as an artist can be exhausting yet joyful. It takes time to disconnect from the pressure of it all and remember that what truly counts is your own happiness with your work. This practice is essential both online and offline for artists, but the quick feedback loop of social media can make it seem more daunting.
