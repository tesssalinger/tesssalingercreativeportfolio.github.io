        This portfolio showcases my creative journey throughout Semester 2, 2024, in the COMM2906 course,
         highlighting the development of my skills and understanding of digital communication. It includes
          six selected artefacts, each crafted in response to weekly tasks that encouraged critical thinking 
          and creativity. A significant aspect of my learning was mastering the ability to critically discuss 
          digital communication, particularly through the use of analytical tools like stakeholder maps. These
           maps helped me identify and visualize key players in communication strategies, allowing for a better
            understanding of stakeholder relationships and their implications. For instance, creating a stakeholder
             map enabled me to clarify the interests and influences of different groups, enhancing my ability to 
             design targeted communication plans. Additionally, developing a LinkedIn post helped me grasp the 
             requirememnts of distrubuting information  in a professional manner. It emphasized the importance
              of catering my message for a professional audience, focusing on clarity and engagement. This exercise
               reinforced how to effectively communicate in digital spaces and utilise platforms like LinkedIn for 
               sharing insights and building professional networks. Furthermore, the course provided an opportunity 
               to refresh my skills in Adobe tools, particularly Adobe Express and Adobe Illustrator. Working on a
                digital storyboard and stakeholder maps not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also equipped 
                me to create polished visual communication materials. Mastering these tools is crucial in todayâ€™s 
                digital landscape, where visual storytelling plays an important role in engaging audiences. Collaboration
                 with peers throughout the semester enriched my learning experience, as engaging in discussions about our 
                 artefacts fostered an environment of constructive feedback. This process of creation and revision helped
                  my growth in knowledge about digital communications. I also deepened my understanding of ethical 
                  considerations in digital communication. Navigating the complexities of content creation using Artificial 
                  intelligence reinforced the importance of proper attribution for any resources used. Each artefact in this
                   portfolio whether it be the digital storyboard, stakeholder map, LinkedIn post, or explainer video serves 
                   as a visual representation of my enhanced skills and insights gained throughout the semester. The digital
                    storyboard exemplifies my ability to visualize complex ideas, while the stakeholder map reflects my analytical 
                    thinking. The video explainer discusses the significance of digital literacy, targeting young adults and educators.
                     Ultimately, this portfolio represents not just the culmination of my efforts but also a significant step in my 
                     development as a digital communicator. The artefacts illustrate my growth in critical analysis, technical skills,
                      and professional communication. As I move forward in my career and life, I am committed to building upon this 
                      foundation, creating impactful digital communication that effectively engages diverse audiences.
This portfolio helped me feel more confident managing, organising and displaying my work.
