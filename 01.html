            Back when computers first came out we could only use them for an online version of the news and to communicate with others more quickly. 
            With the ever changing and fast-growing media landscape, you can use the internet for any information you desire now. 
            Everything is at your fingertips. 
            Pew Research Centre did a study that shows the amount teens are consuming on their phones is causing information overload. 
            Especially with handheld devices being readily available, teens and young adults are always consuming. 
            Digital literacy allows the younger crowd to decipher what is relevant and real within a sea of information. 
            Digital Literacy is vital to our younger generation growing up in this media-heavy world.
